# Premise
GhostGuy is a fun little game where you, the player, are a simple and hard working Ghost who is trying to live his life and provide plenty of fruit and pellets for his family. Meanwhile the jerk, let's call him "Disc Dude", comes into your neighborhood and starts eating ALL of _your_ pellets and fruit! What do you do? All of your ghost friends have packed their bags and left town... It is up to _you_ to stop "DiscDude".
